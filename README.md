# MIMIC-III-Getting-Started

Work in progress.

The files in this repository are intended to help data scientists get started working with [MIMIC-III critical care data](https://mimic.physionet.org/) using R/RStudio in a PostgreSQL database.

The latest version of MIMIC in late 2018 is [**MIMIC-III v1.4**](https://mimic.physionet.org/gettingstarted/access/), which comprises over 58,000 hospital admissions for 38,645 adults and 7,875 neonates. The data spans June 2001 - October 2012.
All examples in this repository use v1.4.

An updated version of MIMIC is expected in 2019.
